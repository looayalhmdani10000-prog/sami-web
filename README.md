# Al-Buraq Logistics — Static Website

This is a simple static website for Al-Buraq Logistics (cargo & freight delivery). Files are separated:
- HTML pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `vehicles.html` (shipments), `contact.html`, `booking.html` (request a quote)
- CSS: `css/styles.css`
- JS: `js/script.js`
- Assets: `assets/logo.svg`

Quick notes:
- The booking form in `booking.html` submits to `save_booking.php` (server-side PHP). Submitted bookings are stored in the `bookings` table in the local `alburaq` database.

Deploy:
- GitHub Pages: Push the folder to a repo and enable Pages in repo settings (branch `main` / `/docs` or root).
- Netlify: Drag & drop the folder into Netlify or connect the repo for continuous deploy.

Contact info used in the site:
- Owner: Sami Alhamdani
- Phone: +1 (475) 222-7511
- Email: samialir70@gmail.com

If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholder images with your real images
- Configure a server-side endpoint (e.g., `save_booking.php` + MySQL) and test submission
- Deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify and set up a custom domain
